Generalized Advantage Estimator (GAE)

The GAE is a technique that accurately estimates the advantage function by considering
both immediate and future rewards. This approach not only improves the efficacy of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO),
but also enhances its stability. You can find more detailed information in this paper:
High-dimensional Continuous Control Using Generalized Advantage Estimation <link https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02438.pdf link>.

    """
    **Overview**:
        Implementation of the Generalized Advantage Estimator (GAE) as proposed in arXiv:1506.02438.
        This function calculates the advantages, which are used to update policy parameters in reinforcement learning.

    Arguments:
        - data (:obj:`namedtuple`): Tuple containing trajectory data including state values, next state
            values, rewards, done flags, and trajectory flags. Please note that the ``done`` flag signals
            the termination of an episode, whereas the ``traj_flag`` indicates the completion of a trajectory, which represents a segment within an episode.
        - gamma (:obj:`float`): Discount factor for future rewards, should be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.99.
        - lambda_ (:obj:`float`): The decay rate for the GAE, should be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.97.
            As lambda approaches 0, it introduces bias, and as lambda approaches 1, it increases variance
            due to the cumulative effect of terms.
    Returns:
        - adv (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor`): The calculated advantage estimates.
    Shapes:
        - value (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor`): Size of (T, B), where T is the length of the trajectory and B is the batch size.
        - next_value (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor`):  Size of (T, B)
        - reward (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor`): Size of (T, B)
        - adv (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor`): Size of (T, B)
