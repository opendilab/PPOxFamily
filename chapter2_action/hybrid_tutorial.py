PyTorch tutorial of ``Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)``  algorithm for hybrid action.
<link https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf link>

PPO is one of the most popular policy gradient methods for deep reinforcement learning. It combines the classic Actor-Critic paradigm and the trust region policy optimization method into a simple yet effect algorithm design. Compared to some traditional RL algorithms like REINFORCE and A2C, PPO can deploy more stable and efficient policy optimization by using clipped surrogate objective mentioned below:
$$J(\theta) = \min(\frac{\pi_{\theta}(a_{t}|s_{t})}{\pi_{\theta_k}(a_{t}|s_{t})}A^{\theta_k}(s_{t},a_{t}),\text{clip}(\frac{\pi_{\theta}(a_{t}|s_{t})}{\pi_{\theta_k}(a_{t}|s_{t})}, 1-\epsilon,1+\epsilon)A^{\theta_k}(s_{t},a_{t}))$$
The final objective is a lower bound (i.e., a pessimistic bound) on the unclipped objective, which only ignore the change in probability ratio when it would make the objective improve, and we include it when it makes the objective worse.
Detailed notation definition can be found in <link https://github.com/opendilab/PPOxFamily/blob/main/chapter1_overview/chapter1_notation.pdf link>.

Hybrid action space is often used in practical decision applications such as StarCraftII and Honor of Kings. It contains serveral controllable varaibles and can be formulated into a tree structure. The middle nodes of these trees should be discrete selection and the leaf nodes can be both discrete and continuous actions. Due to this complexity, hybrid action space needs more special algorithm design and code implementation.

This tutorial is mainly composed of the following three parts with utilities including mask and treetensor, you can learn from these demo codes step by step or using them as code segment in your own program:
  - Policy Network Architecture
  - Sample Action Function
  - Main (Test) Function
More visulization results about PPO in hybrid action space can be found in <link https://github.com/opendilab/PPOxFamily/issues/4 link>.

P.S, If you need to install treetensor, you can use this command
 ``pip install DI-treetensor`` .
