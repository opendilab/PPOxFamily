"""
PyTorch tutorial for basic centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) policy gradient algorithm for multi-agent cooperation scenarios.
This tutorial utilizes CTDEActorCriticNetwork defined in ``marl_network`` and loss function defined in ``pg``. The main function describes the core part of MARL CTDE policy gradient algorithm with fake data.
More details about multi-agent cooperation reinforcement learning can be found in <link https://github.com/opendilab/PPOxFamily/blob/main/chapter6_marl/chapter6_lecture.pdf link>.

This tutorial is mainly composed of two parts, you can learn from these parts in order or just jump to the part you are interested in:
  - CTDE policy gradient algorithm for multi-agent RL
  - CTDE actor-critic algorithm for multi-agent RL
